.SH NAME
pam_oddjob_mounthomedir.so

.SH SYNOPSIS
session optional /lib/security/pam_oddjob_mounthomedir.so

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIpam_oddjob_mounthomedir.so\fR module invokes the
\fImounthomedirfor\fR method of the \fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob\fR service for the
\fBPAM_USER\fR if the module is running with superuser privileges, or the
\fImountmyhomedir\fR method if the module is not.  The requested action,
either "mount" or "umount", is also passed as an argument.

If \fID-Bus\fR has not been configured to allow the calling application to
invoke these methods of the \fI@NAMESPACEPATH@/oddjob\fR object provided by the
\fI@NAMESPACE@.oddjob\fR service, then \fIoddjobd\fR will not receive the
request and an error will be returned by \fID-Bus\fR.

If \fIoddjobd\fR has not been configured to provide these methods, or the
user is not authorized to use them, then \fIoddjobd\fR will ignore the
module's requests.
