.TH oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf 5 "17 June 2014" "oddjob Manual"

.SH NAME
oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf - allow limited use of the mkhomedir functions

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB@mysysconfdir@/oddjobd.conf.d/oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf\fR is typically
processed along with other files in the \fB@mysysconfdir@/oddjobd.conf.d\fR
directory.

The mkhomedir helper itself accepts these options:
.TP
-f
Restore behavior before CVE-2020-10737 was fixed: create the home directory
with user's ownership directly rather than create it as a root and only after
populating it change to the user's ownership. The former behavior is insecure
but may be used to allow creation of NFS-mounted home directories when
non-Kerberos authentication is in use. It is prone for a race condition that
could be exploited in the NFS-mounted home directories use case. To avoid
CVE-2020-10737, do not use \fB-f\fR option in production environments.
.TP
-q
Refrain from outputting the usual "Creating home directory..." message when it
creates a home directory.
.TP
-n
Only create the home directory; do not populate it using the contents of the
skeleton directory.
.TP
-s
Override the location of the skeleton directory (by default: \fI/etc/skel\fR).
.TP
-u
Specify a umask whose bits are masked off of contents of the skeleton directory
while they are copied to the user's new home directory.  The default is read
from \fB/etc/login.defs\fR by taking \fBHOME_MODE\fR and \fBUMASK\fR values, in
this order.  First found value persists.
